<h2 id="volunteers-needed" tabindex="-1">Volunteers Needed</h2>
<p>CAARA is always looking for ham volunteers to assist with the Race Safety Support program and with other Public Service Events that CAARA supports. Volunteering for these activities  is great training for emergency preparedness, it is social and fun, and it benefits the runners in races we support by providing a radio safety net and benefits other public activities such as parades and celebrations by assisting with safety of participants and event logistics.</p>
<p>CAARA is an <a href="https://www.arrl.org/">ARRL</a> recognized <a href="https://www.arrl.org/ssc-application">Special Service Club</a> and we strive to live up to that honor.</p>
<p>Safety Support is a team endeavor. Real-time training is provided to all volunteers. Licensed hams do not even need a radio, the club can provide dual band HTs for volunteers.</p>
<p>Volunteering can be on a trial basis with no long-term commitment.  Join the team!</p>
<p>Interested? Email <a href="mailto:kevinlyonsk1kl@gmail.com">Kevin, K1KL</a> to learn more or sign-up.</p>
<h2 id="half-marathons-are-our-largest-activity" tabindex="-1">Half Marathons Are Our Largest Activity</h2>
<p>CAARA provides Radio Safety Net support for all YuKanRun  sponsored races in the greater Cape Ann area.  Races are mostly on Sunday mornings and generally begin at 8:00 or 9:00 a.m. We are usually &quot;on station&quot; at 7:30 or 8:30 a.m. and typically finish by 12:00 p.m. Each race typically has a Net Controller, 6 checkpoints, a lead car and a trail car operated by our volunteers.</p>
<h2 id="pick-your-spot!" tabindex="-1">Pick your spot!</h2>
<p>Find a preferred check point (CP) or vehicle role (Lead or Trail Vehicle) in each of the races in which you can participate and email <a href="mailto:kevinlyonsk1kl@gmail.com">Kevin, K1KL</a> to request your preferences. If you are looking to be a new participant, Kevin will pair you up with a veteran for your first race experience.</p>
